# GetX-Architecture

This project frame is ready to use for your large scale project and it will save your time for 10000000000000000 hrs. 

## What you can get

- Project include 3 layres. View Layer, Controller Layer and Network Layer.
- Highly optimization of project's folder structure.
- Error Handling and Pagination are ready to use (I already integrated in sample)
- Cache Manager integrated using GetStorage 
- Sample API Call and 'Simple feature' implementation for you
- Localization
- Theming
- Flavour


## Note
- Network Layer integrated using DIO. (I will add retrofit way later).

## To-Do
- If request API fail when you test
  1.  copy json content from 'sample_feature.json'
  2.  paste it to `https://www.npoint.io/` website
  3.  click save and copy generated link(`baseURL`).
  4.  change `baseURL` at in `assets/flavour_envs/dummy.config.json`(development | local | production).
  5.  Since adding flavours you need to run `flutter pub run flutter_flavorizr`
  6.  Done. :-)
